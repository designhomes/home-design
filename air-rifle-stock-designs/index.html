<p><strong>Air Rifle Stock Designs</strong>, Rifle stock design is a controversial subject and the source of much disagreement among gun buffs. The core of the rifle is a 21kg regulated sidelever action paired with a 220cc air cylinder in 177 and 22 and a 500mm Smooth Twist barrel. When FX set out to design a modular rifle it came up with the Dreamline a tactical rifle bullpup classic sporter and target rifle wrapped into one. It does of course depend on the type of gun I am shooting.</p>

<p>All stocks are manufactured for AIR RIFLES only using American Black Walnut. True Robbie I underestimated the price a little. Although Machinery is used for the initial shaping and in-letting of the stocks manufactured each stock is finally finished by hand which includes sanding staining lacquering oiling checkering and stippling. I offer a big selection of the Best CO2 PCP and other Single and Multi Shot Sniper Air Rifles from Evanix Gamo Hatsan and other Top Pellet Gun Manufactures at Cheap Online Sales Prices. Rowan Air Strippers are available in a variety of styles and can be specified to fit via a 12inch UNF or slide-on design fixed with grub screws.</p>
