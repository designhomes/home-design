<p>For basic circuit analysis theory Electric Circuits by Nilsson and Reidel is one of the best it comes with pspice so you can run simulations and help you learn in developing cicruit analysis skills. ANALOG INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN SKILLSET Characteristics of Analog Integrated Circuit Design Done at the circuits level Complexity is high Continues to provide challenges as technology evolves Demands a strong understanding of the principles concepts and techniques Good designers generally have a good physics background. N2 - This book is intended for use as the main textbook for an introductory course in. In reality this course is a snapshot of a more detailed 40 hour course on CMOS analog design found elsewhere.
