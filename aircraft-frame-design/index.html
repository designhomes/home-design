<p>To build an airplane start by putting the frame together beginning at the tail and working your way forward to the nose of the plane. In some aircraft principally the light single-engine models truss fuselage frames are constructed of aluminium alloy and may be riveted or bolted into one piece. Simplified Fuselage design Okay right we want to build an airplane we need to design a fuselage. This design reduces the production costs same frames.
