<p><strong>Basics Of Pipe Stress Analysis Design</strong>, The ASME test formula is relatively simple and provides a quick check of pipe stresses. This study is typically required for piping that experiences high temperature fluctuations or for long pipe runs such as hot piping to coolers or headers. For Protection Against Plastic Collapse the elastic method uses an Allowable Stress Design ASD approach whereas the elastic-plastic method uses a Load and Resistance Factored Design LRFD approach.
