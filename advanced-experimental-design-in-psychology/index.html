Only a small fraction of the myriad statistical analytic methods are covered in this book but my rough guess is that these methods cover 60-80 of what you will read in the literature and what is needed for analysis of your own experiments. There are multiple objectives for the course. For this reason there are a variety of what are called quasi-experimental designs as well as descriptive and observational designs.</p>
