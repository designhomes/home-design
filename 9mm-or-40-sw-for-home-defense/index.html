<p><strong>9mm Or 40 Sw For Home Defense</strong>, Its so good its hard to tell the difference in how they work from other rounds. The 40 SW and the 9 mm Parabellum both. The 9mm has a slight edge in penetration the 45 a slight edge in expansion and the 40 SW is sort of a compromise. 9mm or 40 SW for home defense I personally went with 40 because its a more modern cartridge designed around self defense to use a hollow point vs 9mm that is a much older design built around a ball round to be Geneva Convention compliant.</p>

<p>The difference in price is less profound when looking at premium ammunition. The 9mm has a slight edge in penetration the 45 a slight edge in expansion and the 40 SW is sort of a compromise. With regards to baseline prices 9mm ammo is quite cheaper than run-of-the-mill 40 SW ammo. Most people know the primary difference is carrying capacity and hitting power but lets take a closer look at the numbers as well as a few other deciding factors. Pin On Handguns.</p>

<p>I know someone who is willing to sell me a slightly used walther p99 9mm. The 40 SW has nearly identical accuracy with the 9mm but it has an energy advantage over the 9mm and more manageable recoil than the 10 mm Auto cartridge. 9mm or 40 SW for home defense - Page 4. Most people know the primary difference is carrying capacity and hitting power but lets take a closer look at the numbers as well as a few other deciding factors. Pin On Pistol.</p>

<p>What I am reading and hearing is that 9mm ammo has improved a lot since the 1986 FBI fiasco in Miami. There are those who are adamant that 45 caliber is the best due to its stopping power. The 40 SW and the 9 mm Parabellum both. Most people know the primary difference is carrying capacity and hitting power but lets take a closer look at the numbers as well as a few other deciding factors. Pin On Offers.</p>
