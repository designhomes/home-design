<p>The two concepts research design and research methodology need to be clarified firstly in order to clear the confusion that is often associated with their usage particularly by emerging researchers. Conventional procedures of design such as drawing can be regarded as design methods but since the 1950s new procedures have been developed that are more usually grouped together. Design methods are procedures techniques aids or tools for designing. There is no definite method or methodology prescribed in any of. Architecture Capability Overview.</p>
