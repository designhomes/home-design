<p>In most cases airfoils with reflexed s-shaped mean lines are used on flying wing models to achieve a longitudinally stable model. But if the teardrop shaped airfoil were cut in half lengthwise a form resembling the basic airfoil wing section. Airfoils with a small amount of camber are not well suited for slow thermaling flight but good for F3B flight style and ridge soaring. An Airfoil is a structure piece or body designed to obtain a useful reaction upon itself in its motion through the air.</p>

Airfoil construction takes advantage of the airs response to Newtons and Bernoullis principles. A typical airfoil and its properties are shown in Figure 2 and are also described below.
