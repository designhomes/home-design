<p>A challenge in designing these LED bulbs is that LED light as we know works on DC voltage and the mains power supply is AC hence we need to design a LED Driver circuit that could convert the AC mains voltage into suitable level of DC voltage required for the LED bulb. The circuit is power factor corrected. Save 10 on Orders 500 New Subscribers.
