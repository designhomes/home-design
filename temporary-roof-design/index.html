<p>A temporary roof or building is a sheeted structure designed to provide cover over an area from the effects of weather dust etc. With scaffolding systems that fully encapsulate a building becoming increasingly common the onus is on everyone in the sector to understand the requirements for the design of temporary roofs. This means the use of a private garden terrace. Involves many aspects one of the most important is wind loading that is the main cause of many Temporary Roofs scaffold collapse.</p>

<p>Therefore it is imperative that each ALTRIX roof and supporting structure is designed and certified by an appropriately qualified temporary works scaffold design engineer. It may stand on the ground or on top of a building or be an extension of a scaffold around a building. This is why a proper site survey is required to asses the location site orientation nearby buildings and to observe if there is any possibility of wind funneling in order to be able to produce a realistic scaffold model using structural. Design Actions on Structures - Snow EN 1991-1-3 Actions on Structures - Wind EN 1991-1-4 Temporay Demountable Structures Assumptions The design is to account for snow lying on the roof It is assumed that the roof beams will be fixed to the scaffold structure at each end to allow for simply supported design.

<p>As previously mentioned in part 1 of this article tension barscables or pick-up braces are often specified on the scaffold design drawings to increase the snow load bearing capacity of a temporary roof. We are also specialists in Roof Replacement and repairs. Design Scaffolding offer a first class service in Temporary Roof Systems that provide a water resistant working space for carrying out roofing works in all types of weather conditions. I think this is the reason NCEES and the engineering community decided to make a module on the PE exam for Construction Engineering.
