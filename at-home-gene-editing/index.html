<p>The first genome editing technologies were developed in the late 1900s. These technologies allow genetic material to be added removed or altered at particular locations in the genome. CRISPR-Cas9 was adapted from a naturally occurring genome editing system in bacteria. If my gene editing succeeds this will stop streptomycin from interfering with the E. In this study we developed and tested an efficient nonviral LNP system for CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing which showed gene editing of up to 98 in vitro in multiple cancer cell types and up to 80 gene editing in vivo.</p>
