<p><strong>Ammonia Surge Drum Design</strong>, The exact size is difficult to quantify beforehand and depends on local rules and regulations for the use of ammonia. This factor requires careful consideration when designing the horizontal surge drum. As the liquid entrained with the gas is returned to the top of the surge drum it falls into the leg and allows the gas to be drawn off the top into the suction of the compressor. The design and operation of ammonia refrigeration plants is subject to number of regulatory and standards requirements including but not limited to.</p>

Although they are less efficient the TXV systems are simpler in design require less refrigerant charge cost less ini- tially and usually have less oil-logging problems. Surge drum volume is determined by the maximum potential liquid loading and the amount of fill time desired from the high level alarmLAH and high level shut downLSH.</p>

The equation after simplified is. Sizing of ammonia surge drum The ASHRAE Refrigeration Handbook has some suggested guidelines for this.</p>
