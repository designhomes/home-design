<p>Introduction Balance shafts are commonly found in inline four cylinder engines such as the Mitsubishi 4G63 which due to the asymmetry of their design have an inherent second order vibration vibrating at twice the engine RPM which contrary to popular belief cannot be eliminated no matter how well the internal components are balanced. Uniaxial balance method is to design the balance shaft on the basis of excessive balance method. The balance shaft is a vital component of an internal combustion IC engine and is used to suppress secondary vibrations. The first one is a solid sprocket and the second is a kit to disable the balancer shafts all together. Pin On Products.</p>
