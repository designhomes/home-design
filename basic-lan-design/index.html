<p><strong>Basic Lan Design</strong>, Because each layer is responsible for a particular function or sets of functions a layered approach simplifies the tasks required for hosts to communicate as well as other basic networking tasks such as troubleshooting connectivity issues. There should be redundancy in your network so that a single link or hardware failure does not isolate any portion of the network resulting in those users losing access to network resources. Spend time planning a design that provides network redundancy from a physical and logical perspective. LANs are easy to design and troubleshoot Exchange of information and sharing of resources becomes easy because of LAN.</p>
