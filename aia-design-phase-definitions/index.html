<p><strong>Aia Design Phase Definitions</strong>, A detailed study of all major design structural and mechanical elements is specified in the contract during the design development phase. Definitions for Building Performance In support of AIAs Climate Action Plan the Building Performance Knowledge Community BPKC developed building performance definitions for use by architects. For example in the dealing with Authorities Having Jurisdiction and obtaining approvals for a project which can be indeterminate in complexity and time it may be fair to compensate the Architect on an agreed-to hourly rate. In the pre-design period the Owner will make major decisions that will set the purpose scope timing projections and budget for a Project.</p>
