<p>Red and purple grapes contain multiple anthocyanins. In the first glass put a little less than 18 teaspoon of sodium carbonate in the second put 6 drops of phenolphthalein solution and in the third put three droppers-full of vinegar. Acids and bases can neutralise each other. Blue grapes contain a monoglucoside of malvidin which changes from deep red in an acidic solution to violet in a basic solution.

<p>The reaction isnt easily reversible so baking soda is more of a spot test for acids than an indicator. Blue and red grapes contain several different pH-sensitive anthocyanins. Bases that are electron-pair donors are known as Lewis bases while substances that accept these electron pairs are Lewis acids. Some examples might be vinegar which contains acetic acid citric acid found in citrus fruits such as lemons oranges and grapefruit ascorbic acid also known as Vitamin C which comes in tablets capsules or chewable sweets and it occurs naturally in citrus fruit tomatoes strawberries tartaric acid etc. Easy Chemistry Experiment For Elementary Kids With Little To No Mess Acids And Bases Chemistry For Kids Chemistry Experiments For Kids Chemistry Experiments.</p>
