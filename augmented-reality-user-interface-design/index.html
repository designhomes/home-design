<p>Whatever context Users are currently in is the environment. We present the concepts and the user interface UI designs for two Augmented Reality AR applications which help to tackle these issues. When it comes to augmented reality design many designers try to invent and use new and unexpected interaction patterns. Using the devices camera to present the physical world onscreen live your app superimposes three-dimensional virtual objects creating the illusion that these objects actually exist.
