<p><strong>Behavior Genetics Design</strong>, The idea that better understanding of the human experience promotes better design appears to be gaining tractionparticularly now with software that reveals our subliminal visual experience and how it directs our behavior in and around buildings. By using behavioral genetic methods within a longitudinal design we are able to determine the extent to which developmental change and continuity are due to genetic factors. What is unique in behavioral genetics is its attempt to estimate the extent to which observed variance can be attributed to genetic and environmental components of variance. Together they form a unique fingerprint.</p>

<p>In a child-based design the children are twins or siblings and the focus is on how genetic influences of the children influence how they are treated by their parents. Traditional behavioral genetic methods involve the use primarily of family twin and adoption correlations to estimate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental influences in the etiology of individual differences. Indeed the demands for power are far greater for individual differences research than for detecting mean differences between. Genetic architecture and evolution of behavior We are interested in the genetic basis of naturally occurring behaviors.</p>

Behavior genetic studies have shown that about 40 to 50 of individual differences in personality characteristics are attributable to genetic differences A. Longitudinal behavioral genetic studies of early temperament development are rare.
