<p><strong>Behaviour Design Pattern</strong>, Behaviours Design Pattern is a pattern that we discovered with my teammates during a period when we were searching for a better system tests design. You wont find it in the books. The 23 Gang of Four GoF patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. In software engineering behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.</p>

<p>A funny fact when my manager first came up with this idea he named the pattern- Lego Design Pattern because you build the system tests in the same manner when you construct LEGO. According to Wikipedia in Software Engineering behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects and realize these patterns. This module explores different behavioral design patterns patterns that describe the way objects and classes interact and divide responsibilities among themselves. By doing so these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.</p>

<p>If we have to change behavior of an object based on its state we can have a state variable in the Object and use if-else condition block to perform different actions based on the state.

<p>State pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. This reference provides source code for each of the 23 GoF patterns. It describes how different objects and classes send messages to each other to make things happen and how the steps of a task are divided among different objects. Upon receiving a request each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. Design Patterns Builder Pattern Pattern Design Design Pattern.</p>
