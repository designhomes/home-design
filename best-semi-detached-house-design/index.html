<p>When the owners of this Victorian semi-detached home in a Colchester Conservation Area wanted to replace a glazed lean-to with a single storey extension and transform their sloping garden they turned to architect David Nossiter to design a contemporary scheme. We have some best of images to give you imagination may you agree these are awesome pictures. Whilst every conservatory and home is different the size we would recommend is 12 x 14 10 x 13 internal which is a comfortable size for a family and leaves room in the garden for a patio to complete the home.
