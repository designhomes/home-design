<p>Most laboratory drug screens test THC at the 50 ngmL level so in this example you would pass the test. While no they arent lab-grade tests and therefore not as accurate an at home THC test will provide results that are trustworthy. For a lab-based test the collected specimen urine hair oral fluid is sent to a laboratory for more rigorous testing. Is a quick test sufficient.</p>

<p>Well honestly it is pretty deceiving if I simply assure you a passed home drug test is a solid proof of being able to pass a lab test. You just dont want to spend more than the 35 that a home drug test costs at Walgreens or CVS. Rapid tests obviously provide a faster turnaround time usually of five minutes or less. I have found that with a drug test strip one single smoke session takes approximately 48-72 hours to begin passing the tests. Unfortunately the answer isnt so simple due to the variance in company protocols.</p>

<p>Around 400 pm I got the job offer contingent upon passing a pre-employment drug screen today Friday at 330 pm. In my experience at-home instant tests commonly provide false positives sample is clean but tests positive or false negatives sample is not clean but tests negative. The best thing to do is not to over-worry about a faint line. At-home drug tests can be sensitive to the presence of drugs and if your home test shows a positive result thats a good indication that your lab test would be positive too.

<p>In contrast lab based drug test results may take anywhere from twenty four to seventy-two hours to receive thorough results but may be more accurate in the long run. Regardless of the claims of many home drug testing brands their results are less accurate than a lab test.

<p>How could they afford to stay in business otherwise. However at-home drug tests are easy to mess up and external factors can change the accuracy. So my assumption right now is that the lab equipment would most likely be more accurateprecise than the rapid home tests even with the assumption that both the cut-offs will be 50ng.
