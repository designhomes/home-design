<p><strong>Ar 15 Pistol For Home Defense</strong>, Ar 15 Front Hand Grip is an important AR 15 mod for home defense.

Announced in 2016 the compact RECCE rek-eey series AR-15 pistols by Bravo Company use an enhanced profile barrel with a reliable carbine-length gas system and M4 feed ramps as well as go figure lots of BCM accessories for not a lot of cash. I would actually recommend an AR-9 or a hand gun for protection if indoors. Do significant tissue damage because of muzzle velocity.
