<p>In the USA the API oil classification system provides a simple designation for engine oils to ensure that the proper type of oil is selected for an engine. Calculation of API gravity. The designation would be an API number of 140 with the actual separation point of 102 microns in parentheses. API CK-4 oils exceed the performance criteria of API CJ-4 CI-4 with CI-4 PLUS CI-4 and CH-4 and can effectively lubricate engines calling for those API Service Categories.

<p>Ask for API-licensed oil whenever you have your oil changed. These oils are suitable for use in motorcycles that have catalytic converters in the exhaust system. In the USA the API oil classification system provides a simple designation for engine oils to ensure that the proper type of oil is selected for an engine. An API of 10 is equivalent to water which means any oil with an API above 10 will float on water while any with an API below 10 will sink. Pin On Astm A74 Sv Grey Cast Iron Pipe.</p>
