<p>A piling mat is a type of working platform used for piling rigs to travel on providing a stable base on which they can move around the site and operate. The design of the piling mat is required to resist the forces from the piling rig during travelling and piling. Pile into the leader handling casings and reinforcement cages. When the piling contractor arrives on site ensure the equipment is the same as that taken into account in the design of the piling mat or the Working Platform Certificate will be invalid.
