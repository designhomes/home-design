<p><strong>Are Black People Homo Sapiens</strong>, Wikipedia lays it out nicely. Humans are the only known species to have successfully. Genetic evidence indicates when humans left Africa all known people on Earth had dark skin dark eyes and dark hair. In my opinion the evidence supports a assimilationist point of view but the DNA evidence is up for debate especially the MtDNA which is often offered as proof may be a highly flawed way to estimate the origins of humanity.</p>

<p>They developed a capacity for language about 50000 years ago. 100000 years ago a small group of Africans had a sudden urge to head north. The real issue at stake is that the Denosovans are considered a lesser species of early human placed somewhere below Neanderthals while the Original people according to every model are fully Homo sapien sapiens. Anyway humans only became mentally modern a little while ago and thats the important thing.</p>

<p>Wikipedia lays it out nicely. I meant to point out that I believe black people look more like homo erectus than OTHER homo sapiens look like homo erectus. DNA proves Europeans have Neanderthal genes Africans dont. Underneath the video are sources to the original articles. So your saying black people arent homo sapiens because there not white right take some bio courses hybrids only have hybrid ofspring if they are even fertile - 201477499 added by castellandraco at journalistic fancier Hedgehog.</p>

<p>I meant to point out that I believe black people look more like homo erectus than OTHER homo sapiens look like homo erectus. The modern Homo sapiens sapiens aka all of us probably became dark-skinned we cant be sure they were black like this or that modern population very early in their history as they lost their natural anti-solar radiation protection a heavy fur covering. This small group inhabited the rest of the world with minimal contact with the rest of the Africans who stayed in Africa.

Homo from Latin homō man is the genus that emerged in the otherwise extinct genus Australopithecus that encompasses the extant species Homo sapiens modern humans plus several extinct species classified as either ancestral to or closely related to modern humans depending on the species most notably Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis. Genetic evidence indicates when humans left Africa all known people on Earth had dark skin dark eyes and dark hair. Pin On African Roots.</p>

<p>The answer is yes assuming black refers to skin color instead of its normal cultural meaning. This small group inhabited the rest of the world with minimal contact with the rest of the Africans who stayed in Africa. In my opinion the evidence supports a assimilationist point of view but the DNA evidence is up for debate especially the MtDNA which is often offered as proof may be a highly flawed way to estimate the origins of humanity. I meant to point out that I believe black people look more like homo erectus than OTHER homo sapiens look like homo erectus. Aeta Girl African African History African Diaspora.</p>
