<p>First factorial designs provide an additional control procedure â making a secondary. A design with 9 factors requires 512 runs. Doing a half-fraction quarter-fraction or eighth-fraction of a full factorial design greatly reduces costs and time needed for a designed experiment. Factorial design is now twice that of OFAT for equivalent power. Factorial designs allow additional factors to be examined at no additional cost.</p>

<p>This exhaustive approach makes it impossible for any interactions to be missed as all factor interactions are accounted for. One of the primary limitations is that Factorial designs confound the effects of proportion and amount. Found inside â Page 257ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF FACTORIAL DESIGNS Factorial designs have several advantages over less sophisticated designs. The relative efficiency of factorials continues to increase with every added factor. 5 3 3 3 2 Full Factorial Example.</p>

<p>Second thing if you have only 2 factors the 2 levels full factorial design has only 4 runs. Full Factorial Design leads to experiments where at least one trial is included for all possible combinations of factors and levels.

<p>Factorial designs are extremely useful to psychologists and field scientists as a preliminary study allowing them to judge whether there is a link between variables whilst reducing the possibility of experimental error and confounding variables. The relative efficiency of factorials continues to increase with every added factor. A completely randomized design that you proposed runs the risk of an unbalanced design and confounding factors making it difficult to determine the effect of the individual factors. Doing a half-fraction quarter-fraction or eighth-fraction of a full factorial design greatly reduces costs and time needed for a designed experiment.

<p>This exhaustive approach makes it impossible for any interactions to be missed as all factor interactions are accounted for. When the effect of one factor is different for different levels of another factor it cannot be detected by an OFAT experiment design.

<p>Three-level factorial design A solution to creating a design matrix that permits the estimation of simple curvature as shown in Figure 314 would be to use a three-level factorial design.
