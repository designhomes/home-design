<p>It was the thirtheenth scheduled lunar space exploration mission scheduled for liftoff at the thirtheenth minute after the thirteenth hour. It was supposed to travel to the Moon and three astronauts would attempt a lunar landing on the thirteenth day of the month. This was said after an explosion destroyed crucial components aboard the spacecraft. As a follow-up to the solution your teacher may present Chapter 12 The CO Problem from 12808 to 13300.

<p>An explosion in one of the oxygen tanks crippled the spacecraft during flight and the crew were forced to orbit the Moon and return to the Earth without landing. The stakes are too high and the potential rewards too great to do anything less. This unique spacecraft was designed to detach from the CSM and descend to the moons surface then serve as base camp during the exploration of the Fra Mauro lunar highlands. There are lots of words that describe the function of a design brief just as there are lots of approaches to writing the brief itself. 50 Years Ago Apollo 13 Review Board Report Nasa.</p>
