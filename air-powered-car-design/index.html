<p>Our Summer STEM activities are all about things that go move fly bounce spin and more. The car can be filled with compressed air in less than five minutes with a commercial-grade air compressor which are found at just about any gas station at a cost of less than 2 per fill-up. The power and range of a compressed air engine can be boosted by using the waste heat from a small gasoline engine-say a lawn mower engine-to add extra heat to the expanding air.
