<p><strong>Missile Canister Design</strong>, Large Navy missiles such as SM-3 and SM-6 are designed to be transported stored and launched from 20-foot long 25-inch square steel canisters. One of the most unique canisters in the Navy inventory is the MK 25 an approximately 25-inch square steel canister over 225 inches in length and weighing over 3200 pounds. Like the JL-1 and similar SLBM designs the DF-31 family is cold launched being propelled out of its. Proposed designed and optimized all graphite composite MX launch canister.</p>

<p>The DF-31 follows on the development of the DF-21 the land-based version of the JL-1 Chinas first submarine-launched ballistic missile SLBM. 1 Canister Adapter required between plenum structure and canisters for Mk 41 strike launchers. Made major contributions towards winning Vertical Launch Cruise Missile and MX Missile Launcher contracts. In this work a pressure vessel is designed to simulate differential pressure conditions on components of missiles and canisters.</p>
