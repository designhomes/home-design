<p><strong>Biomorphic Design Concept</strong>, Aiming to inform engineering and technology with knowledge and aspects of performance as they have evolved in nature bionic design can be seen as an aspect of biomorphism. Biomorphic architecture is a style of architectural design that emphasizes natural shapes and patterns. Just as lighting design for a classroom will be different than for a spa or home library biophilic design interventions are based on the needs of a specific population in a particular space and are likely to be developed from a series of evidence-based biophilic design patterns ideally with a degree of monitoring and evaluation for efficacy. The Biomorphic House is facing the Mediterranean Sea from its 1000-meters high the panoramic bay windows have been shaped like amazing sunglasses.</p>
